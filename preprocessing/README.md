SVQTD dataset


Email from dataset providers:

Dear Matthew, 

Thank you for your interest. There are four attached files to help you get SVQTD. I am sorry that I can not directly propose links for downloading since there are some copyright problems to send a large amount of YouTube videos to others. However, it is legal to download videos and use them for academics by ourselves.

There are four files about the dataset and data split. The first file seg_time_lists.csv is about all segments obtained by pre-process pipeline. It includes the segment id, the start time, the end time, and the youtube URL suffix of a segment. Videos can be accessed with "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=" plus URL suffix. About data split for training, validation, and testing, they are respectively in the train.csv, dev.csv, and test.csv. 

Finally, if you met any difficulties in getting the dataset, please feel free to contact me. Have a good day.

Best wishes,
Yanze
